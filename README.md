# RMedicine 2025

## Contributing to this website

This website is being built live, bit-by-bit by members of the R/Medicine organizing committee and other volunteer contributors. The idea is to get information about the conference up as soon as it comes in. It is unlikely that the website will not be finalized until shortly before the conference. If you follow the progress of the website you will likely see information go up initially with modest formatting and little aesthetic charm. It is our hope that subsequent contributions will produce something worth saving for next year. This is an exercise in what the Japanese call ["Kaizen"](https://kaizen.com/what-is-kaizen/) or continuous improvement.
